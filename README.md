# ar-chitect

ar-chitect is an augmented reality (AR) application that allows users to visualize and render 3D architectural models in real-world environments. With ar-chitect, architects, builders, and designers can easily showcase their models in a more immersive and interactive way, allowing clients to experience the design in a more tangible manner.

## Features

- 3D model rendering: Upload 3D models of buildings or other architectural structures, and render them in AR in real-world environments.
- Real-time editing: Make changes to the model in real-time and see how it looks in the AR environment.
- Scale and rotate: Scale and rotate the model to get a better sense of its size and dimensions in relation to the real world.
- Save and share: Save your rendered models for future use, and share them with clients, collaborators, or stakeholders.
